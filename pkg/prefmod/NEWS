News for Package 'prefmod'

Changes in Version 0.8-34:

  • Corrected the coding of the rating-scale items of the ISSP 2000.
    'CAR', 'IND', 'FARM', 'WATER', 'TEMP', and 'GENE' were coded 0
    (dangerous) to 4 (not dangerous) instead of 1 (dangerous) to 5 (not
    dangerous).

  • 'plotworth()' is defunct - use 'plot()' (or 'plot.wmat') instead.

  • Minor fixes and improvements.
